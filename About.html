    <h2>Why I Joined CodeNation</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">After dropping out of university at the start of the year, I have been desperately searching for some kind of career path. One of the suggestions presented to me was working in IT and coding, which I thought I might be able to pick up as I am quite familiar with technology and have looked at the basics in the past, during my GCSEs.</p>
    <h2>My Favourite Musical Artists</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>George Ezra</li>
        <li>The Longest Johns</li>
        <li>Billy Joel</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>My Targets for the Course</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">Over the length of the course I hope to achieve some level of experience and confidence with some of the major programming languages with the hope of finding an entry-level role eventually. I am not an overly confident person at the best of times, so seeing that we're starting with basic HTML makes me feel like I am hitting the ground running.</p>
